## 4. Project Structure & File Organization

Adopt a modern Next.js App Router structure. Below is an example file tree that incorporates both high-level views and practical code guidance:

```
app/
├── (auth)/
│   ├── login/
│   ├── register/
│   └── reset-password/
├── (dashboard)/
│   ├── dashboard/
│   ├── profile/
│   ├── calls/
│   ├── tasks/
│   ├── info-hub/
│   ├── affirmations/
│   └── voice-insights/
├── (admin)/
│   ├── admin/
│   └── developer/
└── testing/
    ├── components/
    ├── workflows/
    ├── voice-lab/
    └── data-sim/
```

This structure supports clear separation between authentication, user-facing pages, admin areas, and dedicated testing environments.

## 7. State Management & API Integration

### State Management with Zustand

Organize global state by feature. For example:

```typescript
// User store example
interface UserState {
  user: User | null;
  preferences: UserPreferences;
  loading: boolean;
  error: Error | null;
  fetchUser: () => Promise<void>;
  updatePreferences: (prefs: Partial<UserPreferences>) => Promise<void>;
  logout: () => Promise<void>;
}
```

Other stores (calls, tasks, voice analysis, TTS testing) follow similar patterns to keep state modular and maintainable.

### API Integration

Create a service layer to interact with backend endpoints. For example:

```typescript
// User service sample
const userService = {
  getCurrentUser: async () => {
    // Call your Supabase or custom endpoint
  },
  updateProfile: async (data) => {
    // Update user profile data
  },
  updatePreferences: async (prefs) => {
    // Update user preferences
  },
};
```

Repeat similar patterns for calls, tasks, voice analysis, and TTS services.

---

## 8. Data Schemas

Define TypeScript interfaces for key data entities:

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  phoneNumber: string;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}

interface UserPreferences {
  ttsProvider: string;
  voiceId: string;
  speakingRate: number;
  callTime: string;
  callDays: string[];
  callDuration: number;
  contentOrder: string[];
  specialInterests: SpecialInterest[];
  recordingEnabled: boolean;
  dataRetentionDays: number;
}

interface Call {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  startTime: string;
  endTime: string;
  duration: number;
  status: 'scheduled' | 'completed' | 'missed' | 'cancelled';
  recordingUrl?: string;
  transcriptionId?: string;
  topics: string[];
  emotionalState?: EmotionalState;
}

interface Task {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  dueDate?: string;
  completed: boolean;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
  category?: string;
  tags: string[];
}

interface VoiceMetrics {
  userId: string;
  timeRange: string;
  average: {
    pitch: number;
    volume: number;
    speakingRate: number;
    pauseRatio: number;
    emotionalDistribution: Record<string, number>;
  };
  baseline: {
    pitch: number;
    volume: number;
    speakingRate: number;
    pauseRatio: number;
    emotionalDistribution: Record<string, number>;
  };
}

interface EmotionalState {
  primary: string;
  secondary?: string;
  intensity: number;
  confidence: number;
}

interface SpecialInterest {
  type: 'sports' | 'finance' | 'news' | 'custom';
  name: string;
  sources: string[];
  keywords?: string[];
  priority: number;
}
```

---

## 9. Authentication Implementation

Implement authentication using Supabase:

```typescript
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

const supabaseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!;
const supabaseAnonKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!;
export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey);

export function useAuth() {
  const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    const getCurrentUser = async () => {
      setLoading(true);
      const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
      setUser(user);
      setLoading(false);
    };

    const { data: { subscription } } = supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange(
      (event, session) => {
        setUser(session?.user ?? null);
        setLoading(false);
      }
    );

    getCurrentUser();

    return () => {
      subscription.unsubscribe();
    };
  }, []);

  return { user, loading };
}
```

This example sets up user authentication, state management, and session tracking.
