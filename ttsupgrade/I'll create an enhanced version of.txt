I'll create an enhanced version of the Telnyx handler that explicitly supports OPUS codec and HD calling:Enhanced Telnyx Handler for HD Audio and OPUS CodecClick to open codeTap to openLet me now explain the enhanced Telnyx HD handler and what it does, particularly focusing on OPUS codec and HD calling features:
What is OPUS Codec?
OPUS is an open-source, highly versatile audio codec designed for interactive real-time applications over the internet. It's particularly important for VoIP (Voice over IP) and other audio communications for several reasons:

Superior Audio Quality: OPUS can deliver high-fidelity, full-band audio at 48 kHz sampling rates, far exceeding traditional telephone audio quality.
Efficient Compression: It uses sophisticated compression algorithms to minimize bandwidth requirements while maintaining quality.
Low Latency: OPUS has extremely low algorithmic delay (5-20ms), which is critical for real-time conversations.
Adaptability: It can automatically adjust quality based on network conditions, switching between different bitrates seamlessly.
Standardization: OPUS is the recommended codec for WebRTC and is widely supported across VoIP platforms.

What HD Calling Means
HD calling (or HD Voice) refers to high-definition voice calling that delivers significantly better audio quality than traditional telephone calls by:

Wider Frequency Range: Standard calls capture frequencies from 300Hz-3.4kHz, while HD calls capture 50Hz-7kHz or higher, resulting in richer, more natural sound.
Higher Sampling Rates: HD calls use higher sampling rates (16kHz-48kHz vs. 8kHz for standard calls).
Superior Codecs: HD calling uses advanced codecs like OPUS or AMR-WB (G.722.2) that preserve more audio detail.
Improved Clarity: The result is voice that sounds more natural, clearer consonants, and better differentiation between similar-sounding words.

What The Enhanced Telnyx Handler Does
The TelnyxHDHandler I've created enhances your Morning Coffee application with HD audio capabilities:
1. HD Call Initiation
pythonCopydef make_hd_call(self, to: str, webhook_url: str, user_number: str, 
                 codec_preferences: Optional[List[str]] = None,
                 audio_format: Optional[str] = None)
This method creates a new call with explicit HD audio settings:

Codec Prioritization: Sets OPUS as the first-choice codec, followed by other HD codecs like G722 and AMR-WB
HD Audio Flag: Explicitly enables HD audio through the use_hd_audio parameter
Flexible Configuration: Allows customization of codec preferences and audio format

2. HD Audio Playback
pythonCopydef play_hd_audio(self, call_control_id: str, audio_url: str, client_state: str)
This method plays audio files with settings optimized for HD quality:

24kHz Sample Rate: Uses 24kHz as the default sample rate (3x standard telephone quality)
Silence Trimming: Employs silence trimming to improve call quality
Advanced Controls: Provides options for looping and audio overlay control

3. HD Recording
pythonCopydef start_hd_recording(self, call_control_id: str, client_state: str, 
                      channels: str = "single", format: str = "wav")
This method records calls in high-definition:

High Sample Rate: Records at 24kHz for superior audio quality
WAV Format: Uses uncompressed WAV format for best recording quality
Channel Options: Supports both single and dual-channel recording

4. Configuration Management
The handler includes methods to configure the HD audio settings:
pythonCopydef enable_hd_audio(self, enabled: bool = True)
def set_codec_preferences(self, codec_preferences: List[str])
def set_audio_sample_rate(self, sample_rate: int)
These allow dynamic adjustment of the HD audio settings based on your needs.
How This Enhances Morning Coffee
By implementing this HD audio handler:

Superior Voice Experience: Users will hear a more natural, clearer voice when receiving affirmation calls.
Better Transcription: Higher quality recordings lead to more accurate transcription of user responses.
Enhanced Emotional Expression: The improved frequency range allows for better conveying of emotional nuances in the voice, complementing the voice styling capabilities of OpenAI's TTS.
Compatibility with OpenAI TTS: OpenAI's gpt-4o-mini-tts model outputs high-quality audio that can now be fully appreciated through the HD calling capabilities.

Integration in Your System
To use this enhanced Telnyx handler, you would replace the standard Telnyx handler initialization in your app.py:
pythonCopy# Initialize enhanced Telnyx handler with HD Audio support
telnyx_handler = TelnyxHDHandler(
    api_key=app_config.TELNYX_API_KEY,
    phone_number=app_config.TELNYX_PHONE_NUMBER,
    messaging_profile_id=app_config.TELNYX_MESSAGING_PROFILE_ID,
    app_id=app_config.TELNYX_APP_ID
)

# Optionally configure HD audio settings
telnyx_handler.enable_hd_audio(True)  # Enable HD audio
telnyx_handler.set_codec_preferences(["OPUS", "G722", "AMR-WB"])  # Set codec preferences
telnyx_handler.set_audio_sample_rate(24000)  # Set sample rate to 24kHz
Then, use the HD-specific methods for calls and audio playback:
pythonCopy# Making a call
result = telnyx_handler.make_hd_call(
    to=user.phone_number,
    webhook_url=webhook_url,
    user_number=user.phone_number
)

# Playing audio
telnyx_handler.play_hd_audio(
    call_control_id=call_control_id,
    audio_url=audio_url,
    client_state="greeting"
)
This integration provides the best audio quality for your Morning Coffee application, taking full advantage of the capabilities of both OpenAI's TTS models and Telnyx's HD voice calling features.
